<p class="h2sub"><b>OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO BEGIN THE
WORK OF THE FRESHMAN YEAR IN FEBRUARY</b></p>

<p>In order to meet a very real need the College has for the
past several years made it possible for a limited number of
high school graduates to begin the work of the Freshman year
in February. Men entering at that time may, if they so desire,
continue the work of the Freshman year during the Summer
Session. Those who satisfactorily complete the work of the
Spring and Summer Sessions are then eligible for admission
to the Sophomore class the following September.</p>

<p>A man who enters in February, therefore, is able to graduate
one year earlier than would have been possible if he had
waited until the following September to enter. Freshmen
continuing throughout the Spring and Summer Sessions
receive the same number of credit hours of instruction as do
those students who take the regular Freshman program beginning
in September. The number of class hours of attendance
per week for the February group is somewhat greater than the
weekly total for those entering in September. However,
experience has shown that the better student is able to complete
the work of the Spring and Summer Sessions satisfactorily
without suffering any ill effects. As the Summer Session
ends about the middle of August, a vacation of approximately
one month is available between the closing of the Summer
Session and the beginning of classes in September.</p>

<p>High school students who wish to apply for admission to
the February sections should submit certificates of high school
training immediately after the December 1st preceding the
February entrance as the enrollment is definitely limited.
These transcript and application forms may be obtained upon
request from the College Registrar. While it is understood
that a complete secondary school record will usually not be
available until the student’s graduation, the partial record will
serve for preliminary consideration of the application. The
final statement will be obtained by the College. All certificates
of high school training must be mailed directly to the Registrar
by the principals of the high schools.</p>

<p>Expenses for the February group are the same as for the
September matriculates.</p>

<p>Individuals desiring additional information may apply to
the Registrar for an appointment.</p>

<p>The Library of the College consists of approximately
21,000 volumes of technical reference books and of engineering
texts, together with many volumes covering all branches
of literature, and bound volumes of the more important engineering
periodicals. The College subscribes to a considerable
number of engineering periodicals and trade journals which
are available on the shelves of the library for student use. In
addition the College has an arrangement with the Newark
Public Library so that books may upon request be obtained
from the city library for reference and general use. The facilities
of the Library of the Public Service Corporation are also
at the service of the College.</p>

<p>In 1936 Dr. Edward Weston bequeathed to the College his
scientific library of approximately 12,000 bound volumes and
65,000 pamphlets, together with his collection of scientific and
laboratory apparatus. Arrangements are now in progress to
provide adequate facilities for making these collections available
to the students and the public.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_NEWARK_COLLEGE_OF_ENGINEERING">THE NEWARK COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING</h2>
</div>

<p>The Newark College of Engineering instituted in 1919, is
a development of the Newark Technical School founded in
1881 by the Board of Trade of Newark. The College is
a public institution supported by both the City and the State
and is governed by a Board of Trustees appointed by the
Governor of the State of New Jersey. The Governor and the
Mayor of Newark are ex-officio members.</p>

<p>The control and supervision of finances of the College is
vested in the Board of Regents of the State of New Jersey.</p>

<p>The College is situated in the heart of Newark at High
Street and Summit Place. The work of the institution is carried
on in four buildings. The recitation halls are adequately
equipped modern structures, particularly suited to requirements
of an engineering college.</p>

<p>Located in the center of one of the most important industrial
sections in the world, the opportunities for direct contact
with industry are exceptionally good and co-operative relations
have been established with some of the largest and best
industries in this section.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="GENERAL_INFORMATION">GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
</div>

<p>Industry is asking today for young men of character and
initiative who have been trained to leadership along the lines
of commercial production. Men are in great demand who
can step into positions of more or less influence and who can
handle problems of manufacture as well as problems of
design. The work of the production engineer of today is
concerned with problems of labor and problems of money as
well as with problems having to do with materials.</p>

<p>The Administration of the College believes that success in
the field of engineering depends, today, upon certain fundamental
factors which are best taught in direct contact with
modern industry. The factors are:</p>

<ul><li>(1) Character</li>
<li>(2) Initiative</li>
<li>(3) Hard work</li>
<li>(4) Understanding human relations</li>
<li>(5) A knowledge of fundamentals of applied science.</li>
</ul>

<p>Early contact with the industries enables the student to get
not only his academic work but also to learn at first-hand some
very important and fundamental things about the operation
of modern industry and about the functions of the modern
engineer.</p>

<p>Beginning in the year 1940-41 two full semesters of academic
work will be given to senior students. The co-operative
work for students affected by this arrangement will be increased
and it will be given during the summers following
the Sophomore and Junior years. This work will take the
place of the alternating schedule now in effect for seniors.</p>

<p>The summer cooperative work will have the same purpose
as that heretofore given in the Senior year. It will serve as
an industrial engineering laboratory where the men will work
under commercial conditions, commercial standards and
commercial criteria. The work given in industry under the
supervision of the College will, however, be limited to those
men who have shown maturity, accomplishment, and development
in the first two years of their College work. It will
be in the nature of a premium given those men who are likely
to profit from it, along with other premiums in the way of
scholarships, exemptions from examinations, etc. extended to
an Honors Option group. It will be optional on the part of the
student and limited by the College.</p>

<p>The college is particularly interested in the study of traits
and characteristics which in individual cases interfere with
the student’s development along industrial and professional
lines. The student is given, therefore, a considerable amount
of individual study and attention from this particular point of
view.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="COURSES">COURSES</h3>

<p>The College offers four-year courses in Industrial Chemistry,
and in Civil, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, with
an option in Aeronautical Engineering.</p>

<p>Much of the subject matter in these four courses is common
to all of them. These common subjects represent the unity of
the basic sciences and techniques of all branches of engineering.</p>

<p>The hours of instruction extend from 9:00 A. M. to 5:00
P. M. Monday to Friday inclusive.</p>

<p>Opportunity is offered to a limited number of high school
graduates to enter the College in February as freshmen.
Students entering at that time may continue the work of the
freshman year throughout the summer. Those who satisfactorily
complete the work of the spring and summer terms
may be admitted to the sophomore class in September of the
same year.</p>

<p>Students other than those referred to in the above paragraph,
who are desirous of taking work during the summer,
should inquire at the College for information regarding
courses to be given.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="DEGREES">DEGREES</h3>

<p>The Newark College of Engineering reports to and receives
the right to grant degrees from the New Jersey State Board
of Education.</p>

<p>All candidates for graduation who satisfactorily complete a
regular course of study and the examinations required receive
the degree of Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in the course pursued.
The degree is certified by a diploma bearing the seal
and signatures of officers of this institution.</p>

<p>The work of the Newark College of Engineering is accredited
by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary
Schools, and by the American Council on Education.</p>

<p>The courses of this college are registered by The State
Education Department of the University of the State of New
York.</p>

<p>National professional engineering societies sponsor student
branches at the College. The societies represented are:</p>

<ul><li>American Institute of Chemical Engineers</li>
<li>American Society of Civil Engineers</li>
<li>American Institute of Electrical Engineers</li>
<li>American Society of Mechanical Engineers</li>
<li>Society for the Advancement of Management.</li>
</ul>

<p>The specific academic requirements in the four courses are
shown on the next following pages for students entering September
1937 and later.</p>

<p>Graduates of 1940 meet similar requirements as stated in
earlier issues of this bulletin.</p>

<p>One Credit Hour is, generally, equivalent to one hour of
attendance per week in class or lecture exercises, and is equivalent
to two hours of attendance per week in laboratory exercises,
during a semester.</p>

<p>While passing marks are required as a minimum in all
subjects undertaken, barely passing marks alone do not insure
graduation.</p>

<p>To be eligible for graduation, a student is required to attain
a grade of A or B in at least 20% of the credit hours allotted
in the catalogue to professional and technical subjects.</p>

<p>All graduates of the College who desire to become candidates
for the degree C. E., E. E., or M. E., must receive the
approval of the faculty at least eighteen months before the
granting of the degree.</p>

<p>Each candidate for the above-mentioned degrees shall
render every three months to the head of the department of
which he is a graduate, a written report on his progress, such
report to contain a brief outline of the engineering work performed
by the candidate, the names of engineering books and
articles read by him, and the list of engineering society meetings
which he has attended.</p>

<p>Each candidate shall submit to the faculty, at least four
months before the granting of the degree, a satisfactory
thesis upon an approved subject.</p>

<p>Each candidate shall appear in person upon the appointed
commencement day to receive his degree, unless excused by
the faculty.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ADMISSION_TO_THE_COLLEGE">ADMISSION TO THE COLLEGE</h2>

<p>A student may enter the College of Engineering as a matriculated
student, registered as a candidate for a degree, or as a
special student, permitted to attend such courses in the College
as he may be qualified to take, but not as a candidate for
a degree.</p>

<p>Applicants may submit certificates of secondary school records
to the College Registrar after March 15 for the next
September opening of College or after December 1 for the
next February opening. The forms for certification will be
provided on request. While it is understood that a complete
secondary school record will not usually be available until
later, the partial record will serve for preliminary consideration
of the application.</p>

<p>It is required that each applicant present himself for an
interview at a time arranged by the Registrar so that the
College may evaluate his probable fitness to do engineering
college work and subsequently to find employment in the profession.
This estimate will be on the basis of physical and
emotional fitness and on previous scholastic achievement. In
instances where the evidence is not reasonably conclusive, certain
tests and examinations may be required. A fee will be
charged for this testing service.</p>

<p>Every applicant for entrance into the Freshman Class must
furnish to the College a statement of good moral character.</p>

<p>Class room and laboratory facilities, demands of good
instruction, and prospects of employment in a particular field
limit the number of students to be admitted each year. It
was found necessary, in view of these factors, to close the
September 1938-39 admissions in Industrial Chemistry on
August 15, 1938, and to require that the matriculation fee
be paid at that time. There is a possibility that this and
other courses may be affected by similar closing dates and
that the matriculation fee may be payable on notification
by the Registrar prior to the registration dates published in
this catalog.</p>

<p>It is requested that all Freshmen complete their registration
arrangements for September 1939-40 admissions before
Wednesday, September 13, 1939, at twelve noon. An extra
registration fee will be required of those who register after
that time. Similarly, February admissions will be closed at
noon on the Wednesday of registration week, and the extra
registration fee will be held effective after that time.</p>

<p>Any other credited High School subject, 1 unit.</p>

<p>A unit, as defined by the College Entrance Examination
Board, represents a year’s study in any subject in a secondary
school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year’s
work. As a minimum this represents one hundred and twenty
sixty-minute hours or their equivalent.</p>

<p>A four-year secondary school curriculum should be regarded
as representing not more than sixteen units of work.</p>

<p>The classification for special students is provided in order
to make available the privileges of the College to mature men
to whom technical instruction in a limited field would be a
benefit, but who have neither the need nor the necessary time
for a full course of study. Such students are expected to conform
to the same standards of attendance and scholarship as
are required of matriculated students. Special students may
receive a statement of work completed.</p>

<p>Students who wish to transfer from other institutions must
present complete credentials including a statement of honorable
dismissal to the Registrar. Applications for admission
by transfer students will be considered only if the applicant
meets all requirements which govern the admission of
Freshmen.</p>

<p>A student must satisfy the College of adequate preparation.
To do this he may offer either:</p>

<p class="hanging2">(A) Any one of the following examinations covering the
subjects required for admission:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hanging1p5">1. Those given by the College Entrance Examination

<p><i>or</i></p>

<p class="hanging2">(B) A certificate of graduation from an approved High
School showing the time devoted to each subject and

for those subjects only which are satisfactorily credited
on the certificate.</p>

<h3>COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION BOARD</h3>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">Scholarship Examinations and Early Examinations for Admission
to Be Held on April 15, 1939</p>

<p>The College Entrance Examination Board will hold examinations
at approximately 150 places in the United States on
April 15, 1939, for applicants for scholarships and for admission
to college. A list of these places will be published about
December 15. A detailed announcement regarding the April
series of examinations will be ready for distribution on October
1.</p>

<p>Every candidate is required to file an application with the
Executive Secretary of the College Entrance Examination
Board, 431 West 117 Street, New York, N. Y., not later than
March 25, 1939. A candidate who takes the examinations for
admission to college should secure a blank form of application
for examination from the College Entrance Examination
Board; a candidate who takes them in order to qualify for
a scholarship must secure the blank form from the college
offering the scholarship. In order to facilitate the making
of arrangements for the proper conduct of the examinations,
it is desired that all applications be filed as early as possible.
The examination fee of ten dollars should accompany the
application for the scholarship tests<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and should be remitted
by postal order, express order, or draft on New York to the
order of the College Entrance Examination Board.</p>

<p>Applications for examination will be accepted after March
25, 1939, when it is possible to arrange for the examination
of the candidates concerned, but only upon payment of five
dollars in addition to the regular fee.</p>

<p>When a candidate has failed to obtain the required blank
form of application, the regular examination fee will be
accepted if it arrives not later than March 25, 1939, and if it
be accompanied by a memorandum with the name and address
of the candidate, the center at which he will report for examination,
the college to which his report is to be sent, and
the series of examinations (admission or scholarship) he
wishes to take.</p>

<p>No candidate will be admitted to a test late, that is, after
the test has begun. Each candidate who is registered for the
Scholastic Aptitude Test will receive a booklet containing
a specimen test with blank spaces to be filled in by the candidate.
In order to secure admission to the test, the candidate
must present not only his ticket of admission but also this
booklet with the spaces filled in as requested.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as no special preparation will be needed for this
series of examinations, detailed information regarding them,
with the exception of the practice booklet for the Scholastic
Aptitude Test, will not be distributed to candidates.</p>

<p>The College Entrance Examination Board will report to the
institution indicated on the candidate’s application the results
of his examinations. Candidates should not expect to receive
from the Board reports upon their examinations.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> The fee for the admission series this year will be five dollars. This
series will consist of a form of the Scholastic Aptitude Test containing
a verbal and a mathematical section. There will be no separate
foreign language and mathematics tests.</p>

<h3>COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION BOARD</h3>

<p class="h3sub">Examinations of June 17-24, 1939</p>

<p>The College Entrance Examination Board will hold examinations
in June 1939 at more than three hundred points in
this country and abroad. A list of these places will be published
about March 1, 1939. Requests that the examinations
be held at particular points should be transmitted to the Executive
Secretary of the College Entrance Examination Board
not later than February 1, 1939.</p>

<p>Detailed definitions of the requirements in all examination
subjects are given in a circular of information published annually
about December 1. Upon request to the Secretary of the
College Entrance Examination Board a single copy of this
document will be sent to any teacher without charge. In general,
there will be a charge of thirty cents, which may be
remitted in postage.</p>

<p>All candidates wishing to take these examinations should
make application by mail to the Secretary of the College
Entrance Examination Board, 431 West 117th Street, New
York, N. Y. Blank forms for this purpose will be mailed by
the Secretary of the Board to any teacher or candidate upon
request by mail.</p>

<p>The applications and fees of all candidates who wish to
take the examinations in June 1939 should reach the Secretary
of the Board not later than the dates specified in the following
schedule:</p>

<p>For examination centers</p>

</table>

<p>An application which reaches the Secretary later than the
scheduled date will be accepted only upon payment of $5 in
addition to the regular examination fee of $10.</p>

<p>When a candidate has failed to obtain the required blank
form of application, the regular examination fee will be
accepted if the fee arrive not later than the date specified
above and if it be accompanied by a memorandum with the
name and address of the candidate, the exact examination
center selected, and a list of the subjects in which the candidate
is to take the Board examinations.</p>

<p>When the examination supplies of the local supervisor permit,
candidates who have failed to file an application with the
Secretary may be admitted, upon payment to the local supervisor
of a fee of five dollars in addition to the regular fee, to
all examinations except the Scholastic Aptitude Test. Such
candidates should present themselves at the beginning of the
period of registration. A candidate who registers with the
supervisor will receive from him a blank form of application
and an identification card which must be filled out and handed
to the supervisor for transmission to the Secretary of the
Board.</p>

<p>In order to exhibit their tickets of admission, to present their
identification cards, and to obtain seats in the examination
room, candidates should report for a morning examination
at 8:45 and for an afternoon examination at 1:45. An examination
will close for candidates admitted late at the same
time as for other candidates. The examinations will be held
in accordance with the time (Standard Time or Daylight Saving
Time) observed in the local schools.</p>

<p>No candidate will be admitted to the Scholastic Aptitude
Test late, that is, after the test has begun.</p>

<p>The Scholastic Aptitude Test may be taken upon the completion
of the school course or at the end of the third year
of secondary school work. Each candidate desiring to take
this test, even though he is to take no other examination,
must file with the Secretary of the Board the usual application
for examination. Every candidate who registers for the test
will receive a practice booklet containing a specimen test
with blank spaces to be filled in by the candidate. In order
to secure admission to the test, the candidate must present
not only his ticket of admission but also this booklet with
the spaces filled in as requested. If the Scholastic Aptitude
Test is taken in connection with other examinations, no additional
fee is required; if taken alone, the fee is $10.</p>

<h3>STUDENT LIFE</h3>

<p>The aim of the College is to train and educate earnest and
industrious students along technical lines. This is the first
and the supreme duty of the College; all other activities are
secondary.</p>

<p>The professional departments expect student participation
in the activities of the student branches of the national professional
engineering societies.</p>

<p>The Faculty recognizes the importance of social and athletic
activities if properly co-ordinated with the more serious work
of instruction.</p>

<h3>ATHLETICS</h3>

<p>In common with some of the better technical institutions in
the country the College does not support a varsity football or
baseball team. The athletic activities are designed to interest
the average student and to develop <i>him</i> rather than to overdevelop
a small group.</p>

<p>Varsity competition in basketball, fencing, tennis and track
athletics is encouraged, and the College each year puts teams
into the field.</p>

<p>The Civil Engineering course is planned to prepare young
men for municipal engineering work, highway work, construction
work, or work in the general field of scientific management.
Because of the temporary slowing down of work in
the civil engineering field, during recent years, streets, highways,
water supply and sewage disposal systems, bridges, etc.
have become seriously run-down or inadequate. Trained
young men will be needed in the near future to take part in the
repair, replacement, or enlargement of these necessities. The
trend toward large sectional projects, sponsored by the federal
government, indicates another field of opportunity for young
men trained in civil engineering.</p>

<p>To give students training in the fundamentals of civil engineering,
so that they may qualify for employment in any of
the lines of work above mentioned, a problem in municipal
engineering is used, providing much of the instruction of
Junior and Senior years. A topographical survey and map
are made of a tract of land containing about a hundred acres.
This tract is then subdivided into streets and lots as in a
suburban community. The water supply and sewage disposal
systems for this tract are designed in connection with the sanitation
course. Streets and roads are located and designed as a
problem in the highway course. Bridges, culverts, retaining-walls,
etc., such as would be required in municipal, or highway
work, are designed as part of the work of the senior course in
structures.</p>

<p>Active membership in the Student Chapter of the American
Society of Civil Engineers is expected of students in this department.</p>

<h3>Field Equipment in Civil Engineering</h3>

<p>The department has complete and up-to-date equipment for
conducting plane, topographic and hydrographic surveys. The
equipment includes plane and engineer’s transits, levels, plane
tables, current meter, sextants, tapes, level and stadia rods,
range poles and all other necessary surveying accessories.</p>

<h3>Surveying Summer Camp</h3>

<p>The complete facilities of the Summer Camp of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology at East Machias, Maine, are
available to a limited number of students who are selected on
the basis of proficiency in Surveying and general excellence
in scholarship. Applicants will be chosen from the group
invited to participate in the Honors Option, and will be given
the summer camp assignment in place of the industrial assignment
given to the other members of the group. The Newark
College of Engineering will give to students receiving this
assignment scholarships covering a portion of the camp fee.</p>

<p>The M. I. T. Summer Camp is located in a region particularly
well suited to instruction in large scale surveying
projects, such as geodetic triangulation, mapping of large
areas, reconnaissance for highway or railroad location, hydrographic
surveying, stream gaging, etc. The camp itself is
equipped with modern buildings, sanitary water supply and
sewage disposal, fire hydrants and fire-fighting apparatus,
and an emergency hospital. The staff includes a practising
physician. Students and faculty live in dormitories (known at
the camp as barracks) and eat in the camp dining room. The
camp is within a few minutes, by automobile, from the East
Machias railroad station. Students attending in 1939 will
report during the last week of July and remain at the camp
seven weeks.</p>

CE 21. Route survey fieldwork is covered in the fieldwork
of the surveying course. The course consists of
classwork, fieldwork and drafting. The classwork
covers a thorough drill in the principles of hydrographic
and geodetic surveying and spherical trigonometry and
practical astronomy. This is supplemented by fieldwork
covering the use of the stadia, plane table and traverse
board in the execution of topographic and engineering
surveys, the methods of gaging streams, the geodetic
and astronomic work necessary for control surveys, and
the execution of preliminary and location route surveys
for highways and sewers which are used in the design
work of the courses in Highways and Sanitation. The
work in the drafting room covers all computations and
plotting necessary to complete a topographic map from
the field surveys.</p>

<p>This is a course in Highway Design in which two problems
are undertaken. In the first, plans are prepared for
the improvement and paving of about one-quarter mile
of city streets. Details of sidewalks, curbs, pavements
and drainage are taken into account. The field notes for
this problem are obtained in the course in Surveying
CE 2. In the second problem a paper location of a highway
is made from a contour map (similar to that prepared
in Surveying CE 2) for about two miles of rural
highway. Plans are prepared which subscribe to the
practice and standards of the New Jersey State Highway
Department. Attention is given to alignment, grade
and cost, with a special study made of the earth quantities
and placement.</p>

<p class="hanging3">CE 30-1 <span class="smcap">Structures.</span> Prerequisite, First Semester
Phys 30.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This course forms a transition between the previous
courses of mechanics (statics) and strength of materials
and the course in structures CE 30-2 given to the senior
civil students. It treats of a more rounded and complete
study of reaction and internal stresses in roof
trusses and statically determinate bridges by both
analytical and graphical methods. Special emphasis is
placed upon the construction and use of influence lines.
A short time is devoted to the approximate solution of
lateral bracing and portals.</p>

<p class="hanging3">CE 30-2 <span class="smcap">Structures.</span> Prerequisites, CE 30-1, complete
course. Phys 30.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The work of this course is divided between a theoretical
study of statically indeterminate structures and
the design of a variety of small structures. A thorough
theoretical study is made of the deflection of beams
and trusses and of the methods of least work, slope
deflection, moment distribution, and the column analogy.
Secondary stresses, space framework and wind
stresses in buildings receive their proportion of attention.
Throughout the work in theory those structures
that are to be later designed and detailed are used for
class problems, thereby making a close tie between the
theory and design and eliminating an unnecessary
amount of duplication in arithmetical calculations.
Problems are given in the design of, and complete
preparation of plans for roof trusses, buildings, foundations,
abutments, retaining walls, trestles, trusses,
girders, and frames of concrete, steel, and wood, with
a study of timber, riveted, and welded framing. Highway
loadings are used in preference to railroad loadings
in order to simplify computations. Particular
emphasis is placed upon orderly and complete computations,
standard and practical considerations of
design and detail, and thoroughness and neatness in
drafting. Given to senior students in civil engineering.</p>

<p>The problems and techniques associated with the production,
delivery, utilization and control of energy in the electrical
form are given the inclusive title of Electrical Engineering.
Any general preparation for the recognition and analysis of
these problems and the mastery of these techniques, in their
infinite variety, must, of necessity, emphasize the basic conceptions
and principles which are of widest application.
Specific applications, sufficient in number and variety to
maintain the student’s interest and broaden his point of view
are, however, useful supplements.</p>

<p>The work of the freshman and sophomore years consists,
primarily, of the foundation mathematics, physics, English
and mechanical drafting usually given to all engineering
students. In addition, a course in the fundamental electrical
units and their application to the magnetic, electro-static and
electric circuits, is given. This is followed by a general engineering
course in d-c and a-c circuits. The classroom work
is paralleled by a laboratory course in electrical measurements.</p>

<p>During the upper class years the principles of electrical
engineering are applied to many problems; characteristics
and operation of direct-current, synchronous, and induction
machinery, rectification, wave form analysis, transient phenomena,
power plant equipment, transmission and distribution
and electro-physical measurements in magnetism, in induction
and capacitance by balance methods and in multi-electrode
vacuum tube characteristics.</p>

<p>A student branch of The American Institute of Electrical
Engineers holds about eight or ten meetings each year. All
upper classmen become members and are expected to attend
its meetings. The second year men are invited to join the
local society.</p>

<p>Since electrical engineering is closely related to mechanical
and chemical engineering much material from these branches
is included in the course.</p>

<h3>The Electrical Laboratories</h3>

<p>The electrical laboratories are located on the first floor
of the Laboratory Building. A centrally located stock room
houses much of the equipment used for test and measurement.</p>

<p>Electric power for the laboratories is obtained from the
Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Company through a 240-volt,
3-phase, 60-cycle alternating current line. By means of transformers,
motor-generator sets, synchronous converters, oscillators,
rectifiers, and storage batteries, direct or alternating
current power of wide range of voltage and frequency is
available. This power can be distributed to any part of the
laboratories on either two or three wire lines, through a carefully
planned distribution system.</p>

<p>Equipment is available for setting up all types of electric
circuits, reactive and non-reactive, for either direct or alternating
current power, together with the usual voltmeters,
ammeters, and wattmeters, required in the measurement of
these circuits.</p>

<p>Several examples of each of the fundamental types of generators
and motors for both direct and alternating current, as
well as the usual transformers and various special types are
conveniently arranged for study and complete tests.</p>

<p>Special types of instruments for extreme range of voltage
current and power are also available, together with special
instruments such as frequency meters, power factor meters,
electro-static voltmeters, oscillographs, and bridge networks
for resistance, capacitance and inductance.</p>

<p>Provision is also made for extensive study of the fundamental
operating characteristics of the vacuum tubes of many
kinds which are so widely used in the control of electric
power in its various forms.</p>

<p>The following equipment is worthy of special mention:</p>

<p>A General Electric Educational Set consisting of a synchronous
machine; a wound-rotor induction machine; a
squirrel cage induction machine; and a double-current generator,
each with a 15 k v a rating and wound for either 1, 2, 3
or 6 phase operation.</p>

<p>A Westinghouse synchronous motor-generator set, rated at
15 k v a and wound for 1, 2, 3 or 6 phases. One machine is
arranged as a cradle dynamometer and equipped for phase
shifting.</p>

<p>A General Electric sine-wave generator coupled to a synchronous
motor. This machine generates a voltage wave which
conforms accurately to standard wave form. It has a capacity
of 5 k v a for three phases and has a ring gear mechanism
for phase shifting.</p>

<p>A two-unit General Electric motor-generator set consisting
of one 5 k v a generator capable of single-, three- or six-phase
operation at 110/220 volts. This is coupled to a 5-kw,
250-volt d-c machine.</p>

<p>Three mercury-arc rectifiers complete with switchboards
and auxiliaries.</p>

<p>Three General Electric Oscillographs complete with all auxiliary
apparatus.</p>

<p>One Westinghouse four-element Oscillograph.</p>

<p>One Westinghouse Osiso.</p>

<p>One Sundt Neobeam Oscilloscope.</p>

<p>One Du Mont Cathode-Ray Oscilloscope.</p>

<p>One Westinghouse Audio Oscillator.</p>

</div>

<p>EE 21 <span class="smcap">Electricity.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is the fundamental electrical course for all electrical
engineering students. The lecture, class and laboratory
method is used. The subject is treated from the
point of view of the physicist. The electron theory is
the basis. For each phenomenon considered a physical
explanation is given as well as a mathematical expression.
Particular attention is given to the proper definition
of the units of measurement. The relation between
these quantities is emphasized by problem work.</p>

<p>Laboratory work in measurements and the proper use
of instruments is carried on at the same time.</p>

<p>EE 22 <span class="smcap">Electric Circuits.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is a lecture, recitation and laboratory course in
the fundamental electrical units and their proper application
to the usual direct current and alternating current
circuits. It is given to all electrical students in the
second semester of the sophomore year.</p>

<p>A general list of the topics is as follows: Magnetism,
electro-magnetism; electric current, pressure and resistance;
electric power and energy; series, parallel and
series parallel circuits; Kirchhoff’s law; three-wire system;
electro-statics; dielectric circuit; alternating current
circuits containing resistance, inductive reactance
and capacitive reactance in series and parallel combinations
by graphical, analytical and complex quantity
methods; single and polyphase alternating current
circuits.</p>

<p>Laboratory work in direct-current and constant frequency
alternating current circuits supplements the
classroom work.</p>

</div>

<p>EE 31 <span class="smcap">Electric Networks.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For the purpose of making analyses of electric networks
the following principles are introduced:</p>

<ul><li>Algebra of Complex Quantities</li>
<li>Kirchhoff’s Laws</li>
<li>“T” to “Pi” transformation</li>
<li>Thevenin’s Theorem</li>
<li>Superposition Theorem</li>
<li>Magnetic and dielectric coupling</li>
<li>Resonance</li>

<p>EE 32 <span class="smcap">Electric Transients.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The transient conditions existing in direct and alternating
current circuits whenever the current values are
suddenly changed are of great importance in many electrical
problems. To investigate these an analysis is made
of the time variation of energy, power, current and
voltage whenever there is a readjustment of energy in
these circuits. The analysis is made for circuits in which
energy is stored in either magnetic or dielectric form or
in both forms.</p>

<p>The subject matter of this course is presented in three
divisions as follows:</p>

<p class="hanging1">a. A study of direct-current generator and motor characteristic
curves, separation of losses, regulation and
efficiency, parallel operation, three-wire and pump-back
tests, armature reaction and commutation.</p>

<p class="hanging1">b. A similar study of alternating current machinery includes
transformers, alternators, synchronous and
asynchronous polyphase motors, single-phase motors

<p>The performance characteristic of electric equipment
depend upon the materials of which it is made, and upon
the arrangement and dimensions of these parts. In this
course this relationship for simple equipment, such as
resistors and magnets, is studied mainly by computation
methods. Some time is taken here for the layout of
machinery locations on the floors of a building, which
gives some practice in the use of surveying instruments.
The quantitative study of materials and their arrangement
in electric machinery is carried further into the
windings of direct and alternating current machinery,
including transformers if time is available.</p>

</ul>

<p>The four year course in Industrial Chemistry is broad
in scope and is designed to give the student a thorough
background in the fundamental sciences, engineering subjects,
and the necessary cultural subjects. It forms an adequate
basis for advanced courses of a professional nature in science
and engineering and, by further training, in the methods of
scientific research.</p>

<p>The earlier part of the course provides the essential foundations
of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Later comes
thorough drill in the assimilation, acquirement of facility of
application, and blending of the more theoretical instruction
of the earlier years.</p>

<p>To give the student a sound grasp of the subject matter,
problems of various types form an important part of the
curriculum. The laboratory work is almost exclusively quantitative.
The student is required to record observations and to
express experimental data in an orderly and precise manner.</p>

<p>Incidental to the formal instruction are such matters as the
use of library, methods of finding all that is known of a particular
product or process, and the writing of reports.</p>

<p>Courses of a cultural nature constitute an important part of
the curriculum. Their purpose is to develop in the young
technical worker an intelligent approach to contacts with his
fellow workers and to responsibilities of a broader social
nature. Like all technical men, the chemist may become a
business executive, in which event some breadth of vision
may be of the utmost importance to him.</p>

<h3>The Chemistry Laboratories</h3>

<p>These laboratories are located on the top floor of the Laboratory
Building, the laboratories being two in number. The
large laboratory is devoted to courses in General Chemistry
and Qualitative Analysis, and the smaller one to more advanced
work in analysis and to organic chemistry. There is
also a balance room and a stock room, both easily accessible to
the two laboratories.</p>

<p>The department possesses the material equipment necessary
for work in inorganic, organic, analytical and industrial chemistry.
Fume closets are installed in both laboratories for the
proper handling of processes involving harmful fumes. A
continuous supply of distilled water is furnished by an enclosed
still. A parsons generator supplies hydrogen sulfide
for the work in qualitative analysis.</p>

<p>Among the various special pieces of apparatus are the
following: A Parr calorimeter, a centrifuge, conductivity
apparatus, mechanical grinder, pumps for the production of
compressed air and suction, various special pieces of apparatus
for distillation and filtration and for the handling of
gases.</p>

<h3>The Chemical Engineering Laboratory</h3>

<p>The Chemical Engineering Laboratory is arranged for the
study of unit operations by the students of the chemical
course. The apparatus is commercial equipment of modern
design, which has been equipped with numerous meters,
gauges and measuring devices for accurately testing the
machines. The students make quantitative studies of factory
operations and of the problems involved in the design of
equipment. The unit operations studied include heat transfer,
fluid flow, distillation, evaporation, drying, etc.</p>

<p>A copper, forced-convection, vacuum evaporator, having
a capacity of one thousand pounds of water per hour is
available. This machine is so equipped that accurate heat and
material balances may be obtained and operation costs calculated
as in commercial practice.</p>

<p>A very flexible apparatus is the copper experimental distillation
unit, which is 23 feet high. This consists of a 50-gallon
kettle, a 19-plate rectifying column, condensers, cooler and an
automatic decanter and feed control. Five of the sections of
the column are of Pyrex glass, so the actual operation can be
carefully studied. It can be operated on several modifications
of batch, steam or continuous distillation.</p>

<p>The batch drier, equipped with automatic temperature and
humidity control, is arranged for the study of the drying
process as it is carried out in commercial practice.</p>

<p>A rotary suction drum filter, Sweetland, plate and frame,
and stoneware suction filter are used in experiments on filtration.</p>

<p>Experiments on grinding include a study of a Ball Mill,
Jaw Crusher, Micro pulverizer, and an Attrition Mill.</p>

<p>The laboratory is also equipped with a centrifuge, sulfonator,
vacuum crystallizer, autoclave and other pieces of equipment,
such as pyrometers, necessary for experimental runs on
the various units.</p>

DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY</h2>
</div>

<p>CH 11 <span class="smcap">General Chemistry.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Descriptive inorganic chemistry, chemical theory, and
elementary applied chemistry. Besides a study of the
chemistry of the elements and their compounds, the
course includes a brief survey of certain of the more
important industrial processes, such as the manufacture
of the elementary gases, the acids, soda, glass, cement,
and metals. The laboratory work is chosen so as to
illustrate the current lectures. In order to emphasize
the quantitative nature of the science, the student is
required to solve a large number of numerical problems
based on chemical processes and to do a certain amount
of actual quantitative work in the laboratory.</p>

<p>This course undertakes a more thorough treatment of
the modern developments of inorganic chemistry than
is possible in course CH 11. Such topics as the mass
law, vapor pressure, dissociation, velocity of reaction,
and kinetic theory are studied in considerable detail.
Attention is also given to the recent ideas of the structure
of the atom. The course is profusely illustrated by
problems.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These two courses form a continuous treatment, the
subject matter of which is selected with a more especial
view to the needs of students entering the chemical
industries than is usual in this subject. The abstract
principles of chemistry are developed in such a way as
to emphasize their practical importance, and to lead the
student to facility and confidence in the application of
theoretical knowledge to his everyday work. A large
part of the work consists to the solution of problems by
the students. The problems are discussed in detail, the
aim being to develop the power to use principles, rather
than merely to impart factual knowledge of the phenomena.
The topics considered in the course are the
pressure-volume relations of gases, the properties of
solutions related to molal composition, the conduction
of electricity in solutions, the ionic theory, the mass-action
law applied to the rate and equilibrium of chemical
changes, heterogeneous equilibrium from the phase-rule
standpoint, thermo-chemistry and thermo-dynamic
chemistry. Under the latter topic are considered the
free-energy change attending chemical reactions, the
maximum work obtainable from them, the effect of
temperature on free-energy and a number of applied
topics in electro-chemistry such as electro-motive force
of voltaic cells, electrode potentials in relation to the
equilibrium of oxidation and reduction reactions, electrolysis
in relation to electromotive force and concentration,
and gas polarization. Throughout the two
courses, the scientific background of the chemical industries
is constantly impressed upon the student. Only by
constantly applying the principles to concrete problems
will the student acquire such a knowledge and the power
to use it in new cases.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This course includes both the theory and the practice of
quantitative analysis. In the laboratory, training is
given in the correct technique of quantitative work, first
in volumetric and then in gravimetric determinations.
Later, extended analyses are carried out. In the classroom
the principles underlying the laboratory work are
studied; additional methods also are considered.
Throughout the year the student receives training in the
calculations of analytical chemistry, with special attention
to the errors of measurement. Particular consideration
is given to the accuracy of the methods studied, in
connection with the requirements of their use, and to
the saving of time by proper planning of work and
choice of method.</p>

<p>The Mechanical Engineer is concerned with the problems
of design, construction and operation of machine tools, of the
power machinery to operate these tools and of power machinery
in general, such as refrigeration, ventilation, automotive,
hydraulic and heat transfer machines. He is greatly
concerned with the problems of industrial management and
public affairs in general. The subject matter covered by this
department has been developed with these points in mind.</p>

<p>The first two years of the course develop a background of
mathematics, physics, chemistry and English upon which the
technical subjects of the last two years depend. An introduction
to the technical phase of the work is had in this period
through such subjects as engineering drawing, shop work and
electricity. A practical view-point may be developed by work
in industry during the summers.</p>

<p>In the third year, the student is introduced to the several
basic courses in engineering such as thermodynamics, heat
power, hydraulics, strength of materials, machine design and
electricity. A knowledge of the problems of our social and
industrial life is obtained by a study of economics, staff control
and business law.</p>

<p>The student’s time in the fourth year, is divided between
strictly technical work in college and an attempt to co-ordinate
with this the cooperative industrial work in industry. In this
manner, the practical side of his profession is emphasized.
The technical work in school consists of applying the principles
developed in the previous year to definite engineering
problems. This is done by a study of power plants, turbines,
internal combustion engines, heating and ventilation and structural
design. In the laboratories, tests are made on various
machines to determine their operating characteristics; fuels
and lubricating oils are examined; materials are studied both
from the machine tool view-point and their heat treatment
and metallurgical properties. The economic side of the question
is further emphasized by courses in management and staff
control.</p>

<p>Students who have satisfactorily completed the first three
years of work in mechanical engineering may choose the aeronautical
option courses in the fourth year. In this course,
some of the more general subjects in mechanical engineering
are replaced by more specialized instruction in aeronautics.</p>

<p>Arrangements may be made whereby students of aeronautical
subjects, who wish to enroll in the aircraft mechanics
course at the Casey Jones School in Newark or in flying
courses at the various fields, will receive credit in their co-operative
work for such time spent in these courses. This
work may be taken during the summer or during the regular
co-operative period. The cost of such courses must be carried
by the student; it is not included in the regular college fees.</p>

<p>The student branch of the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers holds eight to ten meetings a year at the college.
All students in the department are expected to attend these
meetings.</p>

<h3>Engineering Drawing</h3>

<p>The aim in Engineering Drawing is to so train all the students
of the engineering departments that they will be able to
write, to read, and to understand the universal language of
Engineering Drawing.</p>

<p>The work is designed as training for engineers, not draftsmen,
therefore an attempt has been made to eliminate copy
work as such, and to place stress upon an understanding of
what is being done and of the reasons for doing it that way.</p>

<p>The ability to make good freehand sketches rapidly, easily
and accurately is an asset to any engineer. Much time and
attention is, therefore, devoted to sketching. An engineer
must, also, be able to inspect a drawing and know whether or
not it is well drawn, accurate and complete, so training is
given in checking drawings.</p>

<p>The work is so planned that opportunities for the exercise
of planning, judgment and initiative are given to each student.</p>

<p>Every student is urged to set for himself a high standard
in each of the following items:</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Accuracy</span>&mdash;accuracy is a necessity.</p>

<p>Exactness, completeness, and fitness are of the utmost importance
in the work of an engineer. A working drawing, no
matter how pleasing its appearance, is worthless if the dimensions
on it are incorrect, if important dimensions and notes
are lacking, or if a job completed according to instructions on
it will not function properly. Drawings lacking in accuracy
are not acceptable.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Appearance</span>&mdash;a good appearance is a predisposing factor.</p>

<p>The appearance of a drawing depends upon a few simple
and easily mastered elements.</p>

<h3>The Mechanical Engineering Laboratories</h3>

<p>The Mechanical Engineering Laboratory is designed to
meet the general purposes of testing and studying machines
and materials. It consists of several distinct sections devoted
to the special phases of experimental engineering. These sections
are as follows: steam, internal combustion engines, flow
of fluids, hydraulics, fuels and oils, metallurgy and heat treatment,
and machine tools.</p>

<p>The steam division of the laboratory consists of a steam
boiler, simple, automatic and compound engines, low speed
and high speed turbines, jet and surface condensers, feedwater
heater, pumps, weighing tanks, meters and calorimeters.
Each machine is equipped with apparatus for measuring
quantities conforming with the A. S. M. E. test codes.</p>

<p>The internal combustion engine section includes Diesel
engines, a gas engine, Diesel and gasoline automotive engines
and water and air cooled airplane engines. Each test engine
is connected to a dynamometer. Instruments are provided
for making the necessary measurements called for in standard
testing. Several engines are used for study purposes.</p>

<p>The flow of fluids laboratory makes provisions for the study
of the flow characteristics of steam, air and liquids. Instruments
used in measuring the flow of fluids are examined and
tested. Steam nozzles and orifices are attached to a condenser
for steam flow tests. A forced draft fan and a two-stage air
compressor provide air for the investigation of the flow in
ducts, nozzles, orifices and general air machines. A small
wind-tunnel permits the examination of air flow around small
models. The loss of head in pipes, fittings and valves can be
tested.</p>

<p>The hydraulic division contains centrifugal and reciprocating
pumps, an open flow channel, weirs, nozzles, orifices,
weighing tanks and meters. Hydraulic machines are tested.
The friction loss in pipes and fittings is examined.</p>

<p>The fuel and oil section of the laboratory is equipped to
make the various standard test of these materials. This includes
calorimeters, viscosimeters, flash and fire point testers,
distillation outfit and flue-gas analysis equipment. A lubarometer
is used to test the coefficient of friction of lubricating
oils and to study the effects of various bearing metals.</p>

<p>The metallographic and heat treatment laboratories are
equipped with gas and electric furnaces, each with temperature
measuring instruments, for the melting and heat treatment
of metals. Microscopes, both visual and photographic,
are used for the examination of metal structures. Grinding
and polishing machines are provided for the preparation of
specimens.</p>

<p>The machine tool section of the laboratory is equipped with
lathes, milling machines, shapers, grinders, gas welding outfit
and the usual small tools required for metal cutting. While the
major part of the machine shop instruction is given in connection
with the co-operative industrial work, this laboratory is
used to demonstrate shop practice and machine tool methods
in general.</p>

<p>The test work in the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory
is designed to familiarize the student with the construction
details, features of operation, methods of control and the
comparative merits of the various machines. The student is
taught to operate these machines in the safest possible manner
and test them along the lines adopted by the various professional
engineering societies.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The objective of this course is the development of the
students’ ability and judgment in the field of engineering
drawing. The work of the course is based upon
case studies accompanied by short informal lectures
upon modern commercial practice and upon the theory
on which such practice is based. Emphasis is placed
on speed, accuracy, neatness and on the techniques by
which these are obtained.</p>

<p>The course includes study of and practice in lettering,
line work, projection, conventions, tracing, sketching,
shop standards, the use of notes, the reading of blue
prints, the reading of layout drawings, pictorial representation,
developments, and checking as applied to
commercial engineering drawing.</p>

<p>The principles laid down in the previous year’s work
are applied to a series of problems in structural drafting,
concrete work, gear drawing developments, and
welded steel work. Such additional work in descriptive
geometry as is necessary for each drawing is given
as the work develops. An opportunity is given to learn
modern drafting practice, the way a drafting room is
managed, and to develop the basis for future courses
in design and engineering.</p>

<p>This course is essentially one of preparation for the
succeeding work in machine design. It includes the
study of links, bands and contact motion; of gears and
gear teeth, epicyclic trains and cams. The recitations
and lectures are supplemented by work in the drafting
room where numerous problems are solved graphically.</p>

<p>A course for senior mechanical engineering students.
This course continues the work of the previous year
in Mechanisms. It is outlined to place emphasis on the
strength as well as the motion of machine elements and
their final assembly into the complete machine. The
theory of the graphic solutions of problems is developed
and applied to the analysis of the stress in machines,
including the effects of friction. Both theoretical and
empirical methods are applied to the design of machines.
Its purpose is to instruct students to attack problems
in a direct and orderly manner. Three hours of lectures
and recitations and three hours of drafting room work
per week throughout the year.</p>

<p>A course in design for non-mechanical students.
This course is subdivided into two parts. Part one
deals with general design and is further divided into
two sub-groups. The first part of this sub-group deals
with what is commonly called Mechanisms and the
second part deals with subject matter which is usually
associated with Machine Design courses which should
lead to the ability to proportion parts of machine elements.
Part two is for the purpose of making the
student acquainted with materials and their characteristics
through microscopic examination. In this part
of the work the student is required to examine not only
steels but non-ferrous materials such as brasses and
alloys of aluminum as well. This information coupled
with that given in Course Phys 30 should acquaint the
student with materials from any points of view and
should make him conscious of the important part played
by materials in design work.</p>

the distinction between metals, non-metals, and metalloids.
The standard equilibrium diagrams for binary
alloys are then studied and include the liquid to solid
and the solid to solid transformations that take place.
This is followed by a detailed study of the iron, iron-carbon
diagram. The effect on the microscopic structure
due to the addition of a third element such as
nickel, manganese, chromium, vanadium, tungsten, etc.,
is then studied.</p>

<p>The equilibrium diagrams of the copper-zinc and aluminum
copper are then studied in detail.</p>

<p>The technical work of the engineer requires him to write
notes, letters, and reports in a clear, correct, and concise
manner. He must be able to read both technical and non-technical
writing quickly and accurately. His advancement
will depend upon the impression which he makes upon his
superiors. Consequently the spoken English which he uses
in conversation and in meetings will affect his professional
progress. The reading of good literature will help him to
understand how different sorts of people will act and feel
under various conditions, and so will aid him in solving
problems involving personal relations.</p>

<p>As the engineer advances in his profession his contacts
are more and more with men who do not have a technical
background. With these men he cannot use scientific language,
the terminology and formulas of chemistry or mathematics.
If he is to make himself clear, he must be able to
use the English language in a way which will make his
hearers understand his facts and ideas. If he is to persuade
his hearers that what he advocates is the proper thing to do,
he must speak or write so that they feel that he is a competent,
trustworthy man.</p>

<p>During the first two years of his course, the student is
trained in writing, speaking, and reading. The training consists
largely in practice: in writing on assigned subjects, in
speaking before a group of about a hundred, and in reading
selections from literature which have interest to an engineer.
Practice in writing and speaking continue during the last
two years of the course: the student prepares and presents
reports in his various professional courses.</p>

<p>Concurrent with the work of the first two years in English
is a series of lectures on the history of industrial civilization.
These are intended to give the student an appreciation of the
broader aspects of engineering development and particularly
of its social results. They also furnish material for the written
work of the student in his study of English.</p>

<p>An important function of this department is to test, orient,
and guide the student. Starting in the freshman year the
student is advised, by means of psychological tests, as to his
fitness for engineering. Later, the Staff Control course offers
an opportunity to guide the student in the field of human
relationships. Guidance in this field is as important as it is
in engineering study.</p>

<p>Many engineering graduates are entering the fields of
manufacturing, selling, and administration. These men should
have not only a knowledge of the fundamentals of engineering,
but also a knowledge of economic theory, business functions,
and human relationships. It is also believed that a
knowledge of these subjects will be beneficial to those men
who remain in the engineering field.</p>

<p>Therefore, in addition to the training in the fundamental
principles of engineering, every student in the Newark College
of Engineering is required to take all of the courses listed in
the Department of Industrial Engineering.</p>

<p>This department serves as a link between industry and the
college. It is responsible for the direction and administration
of student work in industrial plants and organizations. Beginning
in the freshman year, students are interviewed several
times to determine their fitness and their preferences regarding
placement in industrial plants. Records of these interviews
are used in placing students in industrial work and
in summer work.</p>

<p>The department arranges for the placement of students in
industry and for the details of working plans or programs
for each student. After the student is placed, contact with
the employer is maintained by frequent visits to the plant.
The progress of each student is carefully supervised, and, in
cooperation with a representative of the firms, records are
kept showing the progress of each student throughout the
period of his employment. Students must receive a satisfactory
mark in their industrial work before they are eligible
for graduation.</p>

<p>The department seeks to give the student effective individual
<i>guidance</i>, a gradual, consistent <i>orientation</i> to his professional
life, and a keen awareness of human relation values
of his obligations as a citizen and a member of society.</p>

<p>The department uses as mediums, certain courses extending
over the college career, established <i>psychological</i> tests, supervised
industrial placement, personal interviews, thorough
treatment of Staff Control, Economics and Management and
lectures and group discussions with men prominent in fields
connected with this program.</p>

<p>The department also acts as a link between its graduates
and industry. It conducts a placement bureau for the purpose
of helping the graduates better their employment
opportunities.</p>

are so directed as to clarify some of the common
misconceptions concerning modern industrial practice
as it touches the individual.</p>

<p>A serious attempt is made to induce the student to
undertake some constructive program of personality
and character development, to meet the standards required
of those who can successfully live and work

<p>Confidence in his ability to solve the mathematical problems
which will confront him in training and practice is a
very necessary qualification for the successful student of
engineering. Not only must he be able to solve these problems,
but he must know that his solutions are correct. The
courses in mathematics given to all students during the freshman
and sophomore years aim to provide this confidence.</p>

<p>Emphasis is placed not on acquiring information, but on
developing skill,&mdash;skill in analyzing problems and arriving
accurately and efficiently at their solution. Consequently,
much time is given to written work under careful supervision
of the instructors. Neatness and orderly arrangement are
stressed, as well as efficiency of methods and the checking
of results.</p>

<p>In the sophomore year the same division of time between
classroom recitations and written exercises is continued.
Here the student adds a powerful tool to his equipment in
the theory of the differential and integral calculus. Applications
of the methods studied include many practical problems
from various types of engineering work.</p>

<p>Beside the minimum requirements for completing the
courses mentioned above, a large number of extra problems
is included to provide further training for students of superior
ability. For those who plan to go into fields of research
or to continue their studies after graduation, the Department
offers certain advanced courses designed as preparation
for graduate work. These may be elected by upper classmen

of fractional forms; solution of equations
and simultaneous equations, linear and quadratic, and
the approximate solution of equations of higher
degree; exponents and radicals; complex numbers, variation,
binominal theorem, and progressions (with applications
to compound interest and annuities).</p>

Simpson’s Rule.</p>

<p>The theory and technique of both differentiation and
integration are studied during the first term, with a
few simple applications, mostly geometric in character.
The second term affords opportunity for many practical
applications from various fields of engineering.
The aim of a set of general review problems during the
last few weeks is to teach not only how to use the
methods previously studied, but when to use them&mdash;i.e.,
whether the nature of a problem suggests an exact
analytical solution, or an approximate or graphical
solution.</p>

<p>The courses in mechanics are designed to provide the student
with a sound foundation in a subject which occupies
a position of basic importance in all branches of engineering
and especially in the analysis and design of machines and
structures.</p>

<p>While some emphasis is placed on routine calculations and
development of formulas, the main objective of the courses
is to present general methods of attack and a scientific point
of view. The greatest emphasis is placed upon the ability
to carry on sustained work at reasonably high levels.</p>

<p>A considerable portion of the time in the courses is devoted
to the solution of problems of a practical nature and largely
drawn from the field of engineering. In connection with these
problems stress is laid on clearness of statement and accuracy
of formulation and solution. The technique and methodology
are considered of extreme importance in undergraduate
study.</p>

<p>The recitations are individual as far as possible and are
supplemented by group discussions. It is believed that progressive
tests are the fairest criteria for determining the
students’ mastery of the subject. Written examinations form
an essential part of the courses.</p>

<p>The Department of Physics is in charge of the course in
Physics given to Freshmen and Sophomores, and of the
course in Strength of Materials given to Juniors.</p>

<p>It is the objective of the course in Physics to provide a
knowledge of the fundamentals of the subject and to teach
these fundamentals as prerequisite to later work in professional
subjects rather than as basic principles in a discreet
scientific subject. To this end the engineering aspects of the
subject are stressed more than would be the case in General
College Physics.</p>

<p>The schedule of instruction includes a rather small amount
of formal lecturing with a large amount of informal recitation
and problem work together with one afternoon each
week spent in Laboratory. Effort is made to unify the instruction
in the class room and in the laboratory. The work
in the latter, which is largely quantitative, is designed to
present fresh problems for the students’ solution as far as
possible rather than to require routine rechecking of known
constants.</p>

<p>The course in Strength of Materials is designed to present
the fundamental causes of the strain in material under stress.
Effort is made to present a course which may be of common
benefit to each of the four professional departments in the
College. Instruction is carried out by means of lectures and
recitations and one-half day per week spent in the Laboratory.
The laboratory is designed to demonstrate the theory
presented in the class room and thus furnish visual evidence
of the accuracy of theoretical assumptions.</p>

<h3>The Physics Laboratory</h3>

<p>The Physics Department is supplied with two laboratories,
adequately equipped with standard and special apparatus for
quantitative measurements in elementary mechanics, heat,
sound, light, and electricity. Its furnishings include sensitive
physical balances, acceleration apparatus, coincidence and
compound pendulums, Young’s Modulus and centrifugal force
apparatus, force tables, ballistic pendulums, microscopes, radiation
equipment, and specially designed equipment for obtaining
centers of gravity and moments of inertia of various
specimens.</p>

<p>Equipment is at hand for performing standard experiments
in heat. Kundt’s tubes, electric tuning forks and resonance
tubes are provided for experiments in sound. Measurements
in light employ diffraction gratings, prisms, lenses, and
mirrors. A first class optical bench with Lummer-Brodhun
head, 30″ sphere photometer, illuminometer, and Weston
Photronic cells are used for illumination measurements. An
equipment of meters, resistance units, Wheatstone bridges,
potentiometer sets and traction permeameter is provided for
elementary electrical measurements.</p>

<h3>Strength of Materials Laboratory</h3>

<p>The Strength of Materials Laboratory has been designed
for the purpose of student instruction. With this in mind,
the size of the apparatus has been kept within moderate
limits so that the student may perform the test. The laboratory
is housed in two adjoining rooms. The first room is
equipped with:</p>

<ul>
<li>1&mdash;100,000 lb Olsen Std. Tension Compression Test Machine.</li>
<li>1&mdash;50,000 lb Machine of the same sort.</li>
<li>1&mdash;50,000 lb hand operated Riehle Tension Compression Machine fitted with extra size screw for column work.</li>
<li>1&mdash;5000 lb Riehle Machine.</li>
<li>2&mdash;Punch Presses for shear studies.</li>
<li>2&mdash;Sets of Apparatus for testing Eccentric Riveted Joints.</li>

<li>Portable Brinell Tester</li>
</ul>

<p>Extensometers, Strain Gauges, Shear Testers, for the
above machines. Torsion Meter, Planimeters, etc.</p>

<p>In the second room the cement and concrete testing appliances have been concentrated, including:</p>

<ul><li>1&mdash;Riehle Briquette Testing Machine</li>
<li>Concrete Cylinder Moulds</li>
<li>Concrete Beam Moulds</li>
<li>Vicat Needles</li>
<li>Briquette Moulds, etc.</li>

<p>Phys 1 <span class="smcap">Introductory Problems in Physics.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An introductory course to familiarize the student with
the best methods and procedure in performing calculations
in Physics. Practice is given in the use of the
slide rule, logarithms, mathematical and physical tables,
construction of graphs and curves, co-ordinate and
tabular ruled paper. Emphasis is placed upon the arrangement
of work, efficiency of calculations and
methods of attack. The question of precision is introduced
through simple measurements and calculations
and is emphasized throughout the work of the year. A
set of problems has been compiled which aims to present
the elementary principles of physics as basic to all
engineering problems.</p>

<p>The work of the second term continues this approach,
with special emphasis upon the proper preparation of
reports in Physics. All of this work is done under
conditions which approximate the environment of the
engineering computing office.</p>
</div>

<p>Phys 2 and Phys 3. <span class="smcap">General Physics.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The objective of the courses in General Physics is a
knowledge of the fundamental laws of physical science,
visualized as the foundation for later professional
work. To this end, the courses are administered from
the Engineering rather than the Scientific viewpoint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phys 2.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elementary Mechanics</span>&mdash;Linear and curvilinear motion;
simple force system; energy and power; static
forces in fluids; simple harmonic motion.</p>

<p>The laboratory work which accompanies this course is
entirely quantitative and is designed to aid, by physical
demonstration the development of the concepts originated
in the classroom. To this end, the laboratory
experimental work follows as closely as possible after
the classroom exercises so that the essential unity of
the two may be impressed upon the student’s mind. An
effort is made to develop the student’s capacity for
sustained careful observation and deduction, and to
initiate good practice in the matter of recording and
reporting upon scientific and engineering data. Great
stress is placed upon the precision of the results obtained
in the laboratory.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The object of a study of Strength of Material is:</p>

<p>First, to determine the relations between the external
forces acting on a body and the internal forces or
stress and between external forces and the deformations
or strains, so that the stresses may be determined
from known loads or from measured strains or the
strains determined from known loads.</p>

<p>Second, to obtain a knowledge of those properties of
engineering materials necessary to an understanding
of these relations.</p>

<p>Among the topics covered are stress-strain curves,
properties of engineering materials, thin-walled cylinders,
riveted joints, combined stresses and strains,
torsion, statically determinate and statically indeterminate
beams, shear diagrams, moment diagrams, elastic
curves, flexure formula, Euler column formula, Gordon-Rankine
formula, straight line column formula,
repeated loads, fatigue of metals, impact and energy
loads, stresses in flat plates, and reinforced concrete
beams.</p>

<p>An introduction to the use of a handbook is accomplished
by instruction in the A. I. S. C. handbook and
by the assignment of special problems for solution in
class under supervision.</p>

<p>In the laboratory, tests are performed to verify the
theoretical considerations studied in the classroom work.
These include a study of testing machines, tension
test of metal, test of riveted joint, compression tests,
Brinell hardness, wood tests, strength of cement and
mortar, concrete in bond and tension, construction and
test of a reinforced concrete beam, slender column tests,
torsion in shafts, and stress analysis by means of polarized
light.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
